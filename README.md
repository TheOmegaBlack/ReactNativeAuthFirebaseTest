My second React Native app, made following Stephen Grider's Udemy course "The Complete React Native and Redux Course"

It's a simple app that take cares of login/logout using Firebase.

### How to

```
> git clone https://github.com/TheOmegaBlack/ReactNativeAuthFirebaseTest.git
> cd ReactNativeAuthFirebaseTest
> npm install
> react-native start
> (in a different window) react-native run-android or react-native run-ios
```
